            This extremely low fidelity paper prototype is a great first start to sketch out your idea. If you prefer to do low fidelity mockups with Sketch or Invision, that works, too. The goal is to get the initial steps and process written out.

          <h3>Tips on interviewing</h3><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep them short and focused</li><br>
            <li>Make it simple</li><br>
            <li>Listen and ask follow up questions</li><br>
            <li>Your job is to facilitate </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Keep the interview as short as 15 minutes. If it's longer, make sure you're giving people something for their time (like a $5 gift card for cofee), to thank them for their time. Keep the questions simple and let the participant guide the conversation as they try and compete the tasks. As they're completing tasks, make sure to listen and ask follow up questions if you see them struggle, hear them laugh or gasp, hear them say things like "oh, hmm, well..., uhhh" or sigh. These are all indications that there is an emotion happening, and you need to understand how that emotion could potentially effect your design. Your job is to facilitate the conversation. Don't ask leading questions or try to get them to identify a problem that you think exists.

            You'll hear where people are struggling, in their own words. If you see a dropoff in the checkout step of your funnel, that doesn't always mean that's where the issue is. It could be that just by the time they got to that step they'd gotten confused or lost trust. Research helps you identify why the friction is happening. The data helps you see where drop offs are occuring on a larger scale. You'll get a baseic idea of how many people are interacting with a page. You'll see where people are spending time. You'll see where the exit pages are, according to the user.
